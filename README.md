# Embedded Systems

Objectives:

	1. Build a simple client end of a client/server distributed system
  
	2. Learn about working within the constraints of devices designed to
	support embedded systems
  
	3. Learn how to use standard tools to provide secure encrypted
	communications between a client and server
  
	4. Build a program to a specified protocol interface
  
	5. Obtain experience working with simple peripheral devices
  
	6. Obtain experience with simple networking debugging

Included Files:

lab4_1.c: source code for a C program which uses the Edison to read from the
temperature sensor once every second and output the time
and temperature to lab4_1.log

lab4_2.c: source code for a C program which uses the Edison to send a UID and
 temperature to reading every 3 seconds (by default) to the server
 "r01.cs.ucla.edu" with Port # 16000

lab4_3.c: source code for a C program similar to lab4_2.c except that it
implements TLS to encrypt the connection to the server. The Port # used was
17000.

lab4_1.log: log generated by the program based on lab4_1.c; it contains the
time along with temperature reading

lab4_2.log: log generated by the program based on lab4_2.c; it contains the
UID along with temperature reading sent to the server and the commands
received by the server

lab4_3.log: log generated by the program based on lab4_3.c; it is similar to
lab4_2.log

README: This file

Makefile: executable file to build the program and tarball

Important Notes

	  1. lab4_2.c and lab4_3.c connect to server "r01.cs.ucla.edu" and
	  ports 16000 and 17000 were used respectively

	  2. the temperature sensor was connected to A0 on the Grove Base
	  Shield

	  3. The DISP command was not implemented but was treated as a VALID
	  command with no effect
